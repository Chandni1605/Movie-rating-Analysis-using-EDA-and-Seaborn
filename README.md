# Movie-rating-Analysis-using-EDA-and-Seaborn
### Project Description: Movie Rating Analysis using EDA and Seaborn
#### Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize movie ratings data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. By using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and visualizations through the Seaborn library, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how movie ratings are distributed, how different features relate to ratings, and identify any significant patterns or anomalies in the data.
